Cipher/Decipher âš¡
=============
Decrypt Caesar cipher encryptions without knowing the amount of rotation or create your own encryptions.

In cryptography a Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. In it, each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.
